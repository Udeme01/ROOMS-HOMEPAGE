## My process
I started by checking out the designs provided then I got a picture of how I would want the HTML Markup to be like. I then started out by writing out my HTML, then CSS styles and finally JavaScript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### Continued development

I would want to focus more on creating a neat HTML Semantic Markups. Writing the right markup can help CSS styling easy and fast.
